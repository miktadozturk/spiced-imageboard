This is an Image Board Single Page Application. An app that allows users to upload images, comment, and like images. 
It uses AngularJS for client-side rendering. This project was created during my 9th week of coding at SPICED Academy.

    the username and a preview of  the image and the description.
    • You can search images by title on the homepage.
    • Ability to click on an image preview and get to a single image page where the image is full size and the 
    description is visible.
